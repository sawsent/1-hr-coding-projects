# 📦 In-Memory Key-Value Store with Expiry

## 📝 Project Description

Build a simple in-memory key-value store in Scala that supports basic operations and key expiry functionality. The store should allow users to interact via a command-line interface (CLI) to set, get, and delete keys, with optional time-to-live (TTL) support for automatic expiration.

This project is intended to be completed in **about 1 hour** and requires **no external libraries or frameworks** — only the Scala standard library.

## 🎯 Features

- **Set a key-value pair**
    - Syntax: `SET key value [ttl]`
    - Optional `ttl` (in seconds) after which the key automatically expires.

- **Get the value of a key**
    - Syntax: `GET key`
    - Returns the value if it exists and hasn’t expired.

- **Delete a key**
    - Syntax: `DEL key`
    - Deletes the key if it exists.

- **Automatic key expiry**
    - Periodically remove expired keys based on their TTL.

- **Simple command-line interaction**
    - Accept text-based commands via standard input.

## ✳️ Bonus (if time permits)

- **Persistence**
    - Save the key-value store to a text file when shutting down.
    - Load the key-value store from a file on startup.

- **Basic stats**
    - Track and display the number of:
        - Keys set
        - Keys retrieved
        - Keys expired
        - Keys deleted

## 📑 Example Interaction

```
> SET user123 JohnDoe 10
OK
> GET user123
JohnDoe
> GET user999
Key not found
> DEL user123
Deleted
> GET user123
Key not found
```

---

## 📦 Deliverables

- A **single Scala file** (e.g., `KeyValueStore.scala`)
- No external dependencies — should run via:
  ```
  scala KeyValueStore.scala
  ```

---

## 📌 Concepts You’ll Practice

- Scala collections (`Map`, `mutable.Map`)
- Option types and pattern matching
- Command-line input parsing
- Immutable vs mutable structures
- Basic error handling
